# Uncommon HTML Bug: Removing Element Without Re-adding

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML/JavaScript where removing a DOM element using `style.display = "none"` without properly re-adding it to the DOM can lead to unexpected consequences. The bug is uncommon because it doesn't always produce immediate errors; instead, it often manifests as unexpected behavior later in the code. 

The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates the correct approach.
